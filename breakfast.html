            Cook for about 30 seconds until small bubbles form on the surface. Flip it over and cook the other side for 30 seconds.
            Now, apply a little oil or ghee on both sides and cook until golden brown spots appear on both sides, 
            pressing gently with a spatula to ensure even cooking.
